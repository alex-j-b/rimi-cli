# Authenticate Skill

Use this skill whenever authenticated commands need newly captured live-session headers. If stored cookies merely appear stale, run `rimi auth refresh` first.

## Purpose

This committed skill defines the generic authentication workflow for this CLI. User-specific or sensitive steps belong in git-ignored reference files under `skills/authenticate/references/`.

## First Run: Create Local Auth References

- The AI agent should drive the browser login flow: open the site, click, type, inspect pages, capture evidence, and try safe next steps.
- The user should provide guidance only when the agent is blocked, uncertain, or needs human-only information such as an account choice, password-manager approval, MFA, or a one-time code.
- Do not print passwords, cookies, authorization headers, CSRF/XSRF tokens, or full Playwright header JSON.
- Write durable, user-specific authentication instructions to one or more files in `skills/authenticate/references/`, for example `skills/authenticate/references/local-auth.md`.
- Keep reference files practical: account identifiers, password-manager item names, MFA retrieval routes, login page quirks, and verification commands.
- Keep secrets out of reference files. Describe how to retrieve them, not the secret value.

## Later Runs: Follow Local References

- Read the relevant files in `skills/authenticate/references/` if they exist.
- Most likely, the user is sleeping or away from the computer so you must follow the documented route in a fully autonomous manner.
- Update the reference files when the actual login flow changes.

## Playwright Header Capture Recipe

Ensure the system keyring contains Playwright headers JSON that can access the target site. If the keyring already has headers and the browser session may still be recognized, try `rimi auth refresh` before recapturing. To capture fresh live-session headers without printing them in the conversation:

1. In Playwright, wait for a representative authenticated request and call `await request.allHeaders()`.
2. Write `JSON.stringify({ headers })` to a temporary local storage key such as `autocli.playwrightHeadersJson`.
3. Persist the browser context to the generated workspace's absolute `skills/authenticate/references/autocli-playwright-storage-state.json` path, for example:

   ```js
   await page.context().storageState({
     path: "/absolute/path/to/generated-workspace/skills/authenticate/references/autocli-playwright-storage-state.json",
   });
   ```

4. Read the saved storage-state file locally, extract the temporary local storage value, and pass it to the generated CLI's `auth store-headers` command through stdin or `--file`.
5. After the storage state has been written, remove the temporary local storage key:

   ```js
   localStorage.removeItem("autocli.playwrightHeadersJson");
   ```
